# SIFTImageSimilarity
This repo provides a working interactive code to use SIFT algorithm for image similarity. I have also presented some of the results. Check them out and let me know if you need something more.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.9.13
- iPython 8.4.0
- jupyter_client 7.3.4
- matplotlib 3.5.2
- opencv_python 4.6.0.66
- numpy 1.23.1

#### Setup
Just run the following command to install all dependencies:
`sh setup.sh`

#### PS

Thanks to [adumrewal](https://github.com/adumrewal/SIFTImageSimilarity) for providing the acutal [notebook](https://github.com/adumrewal/SIFTImageSimilarity/blob/master/SIFTSimilarityInteractive.ipynb) for SIFTImplementation. I have added iPython widgets for quick testing to the existing notebook only.

### Questions, Concerns, Bugs

Anyone is welcome to report and/or fix any bugs. I will resolve any open issues as soon as possible.

Any questions about the implementation, no matter how simple, are welcome. I will patiently explain my code to you.

Definitely worth a read!
